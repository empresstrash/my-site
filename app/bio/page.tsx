      <section className="bio-intro">
        <p>
          Empress Trash (aka Dreya Jay) is a multiversatile artist experimenting at the crossroads of generative AI, crypto art, digital sovereignty, trauma alchemy, historical traditions and unfiltered expression. Rooted in glitch aesthetics and shadow work, her creations challenge hierarchies, blending web3 frontiers with introspective narratives to foster creative freedom and energetic integrity. Not for human consumption, her work invites exploration into avant-garde realms, from AI-trained models to extensive digital art creations and billboard features. Currently residing in Mexico City with her two rescue dogs, Glitch and Xochi, she continues to push boundaries in a life marked by resilience and radical self-acceptance.

          Born March 23, 1983, Empress Trash is a lifelong cross disciplinary artist who has created with physical and digital mediums rooting herself in traditional practices and understanding of art history while exploring and pioneering in the digital world. A survivor of childhood abuse and emancipating from her mother at 13, she transformed fucked-up isolation and chaos into a powerful creative force that critiques systemic inequities, media portrayals of femininity, intersectional feminism, consumerism, and mass media in a playfully controversial manner. Her moniker encapsulates her journey: "Empress" for sovereignty, "Trash" for origins as "trailer trash."
        </p>

        <p>
          Empress Trash earned her BFA in Painting, Drawing, and Animation/Design from the University of Iowa in 2014, where she exhibited in events like the Iowa City Arts Festival Emerging Artist Pavilion (2013), Art Speaks at Riverbank Art Festival (2014), Nature Icons solo at Old Brick Artist Series (2014), Gingham Check BFA solo at SAAH (2014), Honors Group Exhibition at UIowa (2014), and Small Works Show at Chait Gallery (2014). During her time at University of Iowa, she worked multiple jobs including: cab driver, game store clerk, public access, art archives digitizing books and film slides for professors' lectures and witnessed boundary-pushing MFA theses. She engaged in campus life, including being a founding member of EPX Studios a student group to advocate for gaming and animation curriculum, contributing to UN policy standard writing on climate change, Mortar Board Society, and end-of-semester dumpster diving rituals where communities salvaged discarded items from wealthy students for reuse, donation, or resale. Influences from this era include Frida Kahlo, Gustav Klimt, Vincent Van Gogh, Edward Gorey, Salvador Dali, Edo Period Prints, Picasso, and Arthur Rackham, alongside various religious/spiritual art practices across cultures, which she synthesizes to find harmonies and reject art elitism.
        </p>

        <p>
          After relocating to the Bay Area, she collaborated with local and international artists, participating in notable projects such as Ai Weiwei's Alcatraz exhibit (2014-2015) and contributing to the Firehouse Art Collective managed by Tom Franco (2015-2018). She curated underground shows from her home, a West Oakland punk/art-house, and held early shows like Sweet Release at Philz Gilman (2016), I Can Breathe at Snappy's Cafe (2017), and Emotional Landscapes at Philz Noe Valley (2018). Other pre-crypto highlights include murals for Philz Coffee (2017), group shows like Dimond Public Art: Art in the Streets (2016), Gilman Art Walk (2016), exhibitions at Bothwell Arts Center (2016), Jack of All Trades (2016), Alameda Arts (2017), and experimental shows as NY Day Show and Art Will Never Break Your Heart in Oakland (2019-2020), plus Create//Destroy co-exhibit with Dangercat (2020) and Red Light Art Show organized/curated to raise funds for BAWS (2020).
        </p>

        <p>
          Since venturing into crypto art in 2021, her work has exploded globally with well over 100 exhibitions, curations, and drops, emphasizing community uplift and innovation while escaping traditional art systems. Early crypto milestones include features at Sotheby's, SuperChief, Nox Gallery, and TED Vancouver, with exhibitions spanning Tokyo, Seoul, NYC, Paris, Palm Springs, Miami, Rome, LA, SXSW, Mexico City, and Melbourne. Beyond art exhibitions, she has spoke at the Creative Commons Global Summit on crypto art and #cc0 ethos, been featured in extensive podcasts, interviews and publications, and has rescued wild animals like a raccoon, opossum, and crow.

        <p>
          Empress Trash's art embraces abstraction, surrealism, glitch aesthetics, and AI, continually seeking new accessible technologies like Midjourney for surreal visions and custom models on platforms like Titles.xyz. Her process-oriented approach leverages radical expressionism and self-acceptance, delving into meditative explorations of subconscious connections between emotional, physical, mental, sexual, and spiritual realms. Digital art is not new to her, with being an OG on DeviantArt as trash-empress (active since ~2003), she shared early digital portraits, line art, coloring pages, graphic weirdness, and sketches/quick draws, rejecting elitism and drawing from diverse influences. Her Instagram (@empress_trash), X (@empresstrash) and TikTok (@empress_trash) showcases the diverse works she creates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Empress Trash is also a metaverse builder, passionately creating virtual spaces to extend her artistic sovereignty. She has built galleries and experiences in Cryptovoxels, contributing to immersive environments that blend glitch, trash and digital outsider art with interactive experiences, including Dumpster Palace Gallery. She participated in XoB Gallery's virtual exhibitions as artist in residency, showcasing glitchy, avant-garde pieces in metaverse galleries, emphasizing digital ownership and accessibility. Currently, she focuses on Nifty Island, where she designs and curates islands that serve as digital sanctuaries for community engagement and creative rebellion, including her first Prismata island.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a very early adopter on platforms like Objkt, Rodeo, Zora, Farcaster, Lens, and now the Base app, Empress Trash actively contributes to critiquing social medias and their evolution in web3, advocating for decentralized, artist-centric models that prioritize sovereignty, collaboration over centralized control. Her insights on building equitable ecosystems have influenced discussions on how these platforms can avoid repeating web2 pitfalls, fostering true community-driven innovation and exploring what equitable, merit based systems mean while exploring new technology being developed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, Empress Trash is focused on training AI models while testing and advocating for ethical training standards and exploring video creation, doing the good ol vibe devving for custom tools and applications, and creating an indie game (TBA) and making art as always. This new phase represents her transition from deep introspective works to outward expression and solidifying her commitment to pushing technological boundaries while maintaining her chaotic neutral polarity.
